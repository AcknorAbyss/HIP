## Summary

This HIP suggests slashing Helium Mobile service provider stake (currently 500 million MOBILE) by 10% (50,000,000 MOBILE) for importing an incorrect RF pattern on the antenna KP-3Q0MA-13. 

## Stakeholders

Nova and Heloium Mobile
Wi-Fi and CBRS Mobile Deployments

## Detailed Explanation

We suggest this slashing due to importing an inaccurate RF pattern for the antenna pattern of KP-3Q0MA-13 for the NOVA-436 radios in the CPI submission process. The CPI submissions for this antenna that were previously authorized and accepted months prior were promptly rejected without warning on 28/02/2024 bringing down the accessibility of many CBRS radios due to a mistake by one of the Nova employees. The KP-3Q0MA-13 was also listed on the official HelloHelium Planner as a usable antenna. Both parties, Nova and Helium Mobile, should be held accountable for this mistake.

## Motivation

To hold service providers and Nova accountable for mistakes that are controllable and avoidable, and encourage more professional communication and handling within the community.

## Drawbacks

None

## Rationale and Alternatives

This would be the first slashing of a service provider and set a starting point for future slashes. 

## Unresolved Questions

Is Nova allowed to vote on this?

## Deployment Impact

None

## Success Metrics

Nova and Helium Mobile will be more careful in the future by changing the readiness of the network.
