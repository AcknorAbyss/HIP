# Summary
[summary]: #summary
A comprehensive set of improvements to Proof-of-Coverage, the scoring system, how Hotspots join the network, and participate in mining and the HBBFT consensus group.

Note: Changes to PoC pathing are not included in this document but are being prepared as an add-on component. The reason for not including this immediately is largely time constraints before
Helium community call of 9/2020.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation
A refactor, and ultimate redesign of PoC is necessary to ensure fairness of a decentralized network as the current implementation shows that gateways can send and receive signals, but does not prove these same gateways could receive signals in the area they occupy other than from their witnesses.

## Engaging Untrustworthy Actors
[engaging-actors]: #engaging-actors

The goal of Proof of Coverage is to define, incintivize, and measure coverage by hotspots in a trustless system. Ultimately, the methods used should
allow the Helium network to engage more untrustworthy actors and allow them to join and participate in the network. In order to accomplish this task,
several solutions are applied to cover three areas needed to complete the task of PoC. Each of these methods can be reviewed in detail through attached
documentation, with the overall process focused on trust and leveling highlighted here for clarity. 

The process of PoC is described in `Levels of Trust`. Described as a progression through levels, PoC allows a trustless entry point with logical progression
of responsibility and associated privlidges as trust is gained.

## Levels of Trust

Network assumptions:

* Every hotspot joining the network starts at the first level.
* Every successive level is granted the priviledges of all previous levels.
* Organic network growth allows hotspots to get to level 3.

### Level 1: Network Initiate

Hotspots which first join the network can be completely untrusted, and are afforded the opportunity to prove their validity
through minimal network interaction. These actions are intended to establish a sense of how a new hotspot is connected to the greater
Helium network and prepare it for the next level of participation without sacrificing any ability to traffic data from devices or be
excluded from the rewards associated for that work independed of PoC.

- Every hotspot which joins the helium network starts at Level 1 by issuing an `add_gateway` transaction and `assert_location`.
- The entry fee is set to burning data credits worth $10 USD.
- A hotspot at Level 1 is allowed to transmit data.
- A hotspot at Level 1 will begin broadcasting to build its own witness list in preparation for Level 2.
- Level 1 hotspots are only capable of earning HNT through data transfer.

#### Level 1 Progression

- Level 1 hotspots broadcast to their local area, with surrounding hotspots L2 and above witnessing.
- If the L1 hotspot has sufficient neighbors with valid witness receipts in an epoch, it can be promoted to L2.

### Level 2: Network Observer

Once a new hotspot has gained knowledge of it's connected parties, it can begin participating as a witness to it's neighbors
performing PoC challenges. This participation is evaluated by the network in preparation for wider PoC participation once
sufficient history and validity is obtained.

- Level 2 hotspots are eligible to earn HNT by witnessing data transfer and issuing challenges.

#### Level 2 Progression

- Level 2 hotspots witness broadcast and PoC transmissions from neighboring hotspots.
- Level 2 hotspots require a trusted hotspot (hotspots instantiated as level 3) or level 3 hotspot to promoted as only L3 hotspots
  are capable of performing PoC transmissions as challengee.
- If the L2 hotspot collects sufficient valid PoC data within an epoch to be classified as trustworthy, it can be promoted to L3.

### Level 3: PoC Candidate

A PoC candidate has been classified as sufficiently trustworthy, and can now be a direct participant in PoC challenges. Maintaining
this trustworthyness is required of all level 3 hotspots, and the output of maintaining this status allows for potential consensus
participation and validation of other level 2 and 3 hotspots.

- A hotspot at Level 3 can participate in PoC challenges as a challengee, witness, and challenger.
- Level 3 hotspots are allowed to earn HNT as a challenger, challengee, witness, and data transferer.

#### Level 3 Progression

- Level 3 hotspots transmit PoCs, and witness both broadcast and PoC transmissions.
- If the L3 hotspot can be classified by the majority of its witnesses as trustworthy with high probability in every epoch, it can be promoted to L4.

### Level 4: Consensus Candidates

Consensus election occurs among the most trusted of hotspots which must consistantly show their high quality of network participation. 

- A hotspot at Level 4 gains additional access to consensus membership candidacy.
- Entry clause: Highly trusted, staked, and voted upon validators. TBD on chain voting.

#### Level 4 Preservation

- Level 4 hotspots must continuously be classified by the majority of their witnesses as trustorthy with small deviation from the trustworthy classification
  to maintain L4 status.

## Level Demotion

Level demotion is possible at any position in the leveling scheme. Performance found to be unsutible would require this confidence to be rebuilt
as a Level 2 participant, and in the event of a re-assert, a Level 1 participant.

## Effect on Hotspots in the Wild

Hotspots exibiting good behavior in the wild currently should see no meaningful change in performance. It is possible that clusters of
hotspots exhibiting bad behavior before this is implemented were biasing the distribution of earnings, which would be rebalanced as a result
of this change, resulting in a redistribution of earnings for all other hotspots. The redistribution is not practically predictiable currently.

## 3rd Party Gateways

The reasoning for disallowing 3rd party gateways until this point has been the inability to evaluate their trustworthyness with varying hardware.
Our proof mechanism becomes more robust, adding a flexible learning method to train for a potentially unlimited number of classifications,
limiting the participation impact of hotspots below L3, and requiring continuous evidence of good behavior related to group of hotspots to determine
validity. After implementation of the SOM as a component of PoC, we believe it is possible to evaluate 3rd party gateway performance and classify their
trustworthyness with reasonable confidence dynamically. Methods of abusing a static system are unbounded, and providing an adaptive solution to identify
changing behavior (with or without developer intervention) can allow for broader participation safely.

## Classificaion Methods

For classification, we have implemented a semi-supervised learning method to identify behavior of hotspots in a dynamic fashion. A brief
simplified explanation of how it works as well as a detailed explanation can be found in the following document.

TODO: Add determining trust document when appropriate.

## Challenge Selection Methods

A scaling method of challenge selection is applied to appropriately challenge clusters of linked hotspots, and rate limit challenges to map global coverage fairly.
A more detailed explanation of this implementation can be found in the following document.

TODO: Add challenge selection document when appropriate

## PoC Transaction Methods

Changes to the physical implementation of PoC transactions, the link layer transmissions, and validation of transactions are explained in detail in the
following document.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

- We will be starting with a group of assumed trusted hotspots to establish validity of the network and allow for promotion of non-L2 or above hotspots. These
  will come from the existing network at the time of deployment.
 
# Rationale and Alternatives
[alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

- It is advantageous to use this proposed design for its flexibility in identifying existing patterns as well as new patterns of behavior. Static
  solutions are easier to predict and work against for bad actors because the system conditions do not change to meet the expected input. Additionally
  increasing the input data and richness of this data will only serve to improve what identifying factors are for trusted and high quality connectivity
  as well as the opposite. The identifying parameters can be expanded at will along with the classifications to suit the growing needs of a network.

- Some static solutions have been suggested which either alter results or simply filter signal data. They are simpler to implement due to narrower
  problem scope.

- With no change, individuals will continue to game the system in predictiable and highly repeatable ways.

# Unresolved Questions
[unresolved]: #unresolved-questions

- Quantity and distribution of rewards is considered out of scope for this HIP.

# Deployment Impact
[deployment-impact]: #deployment-impact

- Deployment of this system will have a direct impact on current hotspot deployments which are exibiting poor behavior.

- Backwards compatibility does not apply to this situation, however training modifications are easily implemented for updates and improvments.

# Success Metrics
[success-metrics]: #success-metrics

What metrics can be used to measure the success of this design?

- Clusters of hotspots exhibiting good behavior should see increased score rating.

- Clusters of hotspots known to be exhibiting bad behavior should be excluded from PoC participation and Consensus.
